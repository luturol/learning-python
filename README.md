# Learning Python

This is a repository that I'm using to learn aboyt Python and training my programming logic skills.

You can read more about my motivations for this repository in my [personal blog](https://luturol.github.io/python/2019/10/18/Python-100.html).

I'll be doing some Hacker Rank, Code Wars and others to improve my skills.
